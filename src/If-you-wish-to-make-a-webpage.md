I was in a quandry. I wanted to write some bloviating posts containing stylized code snippets (sorry [medium](https://medium.com). I didn't want to pay any money (sorry [svbtle](https://svbtle.com/). I didn't want a solution that tries to do everything just so I can turn simple markdown files into html (sorry [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)). So I did what millions of people before me have done, I reinvented the wheel.  
  
Behold [mdp](https://github.com/mmaelzer/mdp), a command line tool that takes markdown files and a template file and does exactly what I want, it generates stupid html files. As an added bonus, I wanted to play around in [Go](https://golang.org/), and this provided an opportunity to make a tiny command line utility using golang. As expected, it was a delight.
