<p>I was in a quandry. I wanted to write some bloviating posts with stylized code snippets (sorry <a href="https://medium.com">medium</a>). I didn&rsquo;t want to pay any money (sorry <a href="https://svbtle.com/">svbtle</a>). I didn&rsquo;t want a solution that tries to do everything even though all I want to do is turn simple markdown files into html (sorry <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>). So I did what millions of people before me have done, I reinvented the wheel.</p>

<p>Behold <a href="https://github.com/mmaelzer/mdp">mdp</a>, a command line tool that takes markdown files and a template file and does exactly what I want, it generates stupid html files. As an added bonus, I wanted to play around in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, and this provided an opportunity to make a tiny command line utility using golang. As expected, it was a delight.</p>
